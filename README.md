🌱 Agrinova - Smart Farming

Agrinova is a smart farming web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It demonstrates how IoT (ESP32 microcontroller) can be integrated with AI-powered features to help farmers with disease detection, smart irrigation, and live monitoring.

🚀 Features
   🌿 Smart Irrigation – Automates water usage using real-time sensor data.
   🌡️ Temperature Monitoring – Tracks live ambient and soil temperature.
   🦠 Disease Detection (ESP32 Simulation) – AI-powered early detection of crop diseases.
   📊 Sensor Dashboard – Displays temperature, soil moisture, water pump status, and ESP32 health.
   📩 Contact Form – Integrated with EmailJS for direct messaging.
   📍 Location-based Weather – Dynamic weather link based on user’s geolocation.
   ✨ Smooth Animations – Interactive UI with smooth scrolling and hover effects.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
IoT Integration (Simulated): ESP32 microcontroller
Email Service: EmailJS
Styling: Responsive design with animations & dark mode
